# Visual explanation of the Maximum Diversity Problem through Genetic Algorithms

This repository is home to a python-based solution for the Maximum Diversity Problem. 

The main file is `src/mdp.py`, all other files serve as helper functions or hold the results yielded through the experimentation.

This repository is a Manim based animation to try and explain how this problem works and how the possible solutions can be found.
